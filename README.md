# 8085-smart-mirror
Open source project which aims at making a smart mirror using Intel 8085 with esp8266 as wifi interface.

# Project Abstract
Our smart mirror won’t just say you’re the prettiest of them all. It will also tell you the temperature, daily tasks(to-do list), weather outside, upcoming calendar appointments, and more. Encapsulated within a wooden frame, it will consist of a two-way mirror with an electronic display and wifi module behind the mirror. In form of widgets, it deploys various multi-colour LED's accompanied with stencils to form an iconic indicator for various weather conditions.

An essential part of modern interior designing ideas is the use of mirrors. Long gong are the days, when mirror is just used to see your face. Now, Mirrors being an integral part of every household are now used to provide glamorous user-interface for a variety of smart products. Our project, 8085 based smart mirror is an attempt to intermingle our modern luxury with a so called 'obsolete' Intel's microprocessor 8085. 

Main objective of our work is to keep the user updated with his To-Do list, which was once entered by the user, stored securely on a reliable cloud database. With our Smart Mirror android application interface, user can smoothly update the data, with his location (required for weather) along with the SSID and password of the wireless interface, being used for data exchange purpose.
Along with this, weather forecast along with temperature is displayed for user's convenience.
